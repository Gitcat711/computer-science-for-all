### What is Database Client?

A Database Client is any piece of software(also known as Database Management Tools) that issues the Database Server, which holds the data. A Database Client is essential to have access to the database, and there are many types:

- Software Packages(like pg in Node, or jdbc in Java)
- Command Line Applications
- GUI interfaces.

As a client we do not need to know how data gets allocated on the storage device and how the server configuration gets set up.
Some of teh Database Clients can act as one or both of the following things:
- The end user GUI/command line database management system which is connected to the database server.
- When used as a software package, it can act as an intermediary between other applications and the database that holds the data.
