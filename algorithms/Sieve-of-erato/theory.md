## Sieve of Eratothenes

- **Sieve of Eratothenes** is a simple algorithm for finding all the prime numbers smaller than a given value. The algorithm dates way back to _20BC_.

- The Simplicity of the algorithm comes from the fact that no primarily testing, which will be necessary.

- A prime number is the number that has exactly  two distinct natural divisor: 1 and _itself_. Every prime number (other than 2) will therefore be odd.
