### General Points to remember.

- **Non-deterministic** push down automata(_NPDA_) is more powerful than **Deterministic** push down automata(_DPDA_).
- The Halting problem of Turing machine is recursively enumerable but not recursive.
- Two Turing machines are said to be similar, if they both accept same class of languages. Standard Turing machines have a single machine. Standard Turing machines have a single, one dimensional tape, with one tape head.
- All Turing machines are equivalent to the standard Turing machine.
