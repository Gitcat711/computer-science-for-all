### Binary
> There are 10 types of people, One who understand Binary and One who doesn't.

#### The Basics
- **Binary numbers** (or **base-2**) only use two values,0 and 1. So binary digit columns increase by 2 times (_1s, 2s, 4s_).

- Binary numbers are nice for computers because they can easily be expressed as series of bits, which only have two states (think of them as "on" or "off", "open" or "closed", or 000 or 111).  

- Here are the base-10 numbers 0 through 10 in _binary_.

|Binary|Decimal|

|6|0110|
|7|0111|
|8|1000|
