## The Queue Data Structure.
The _Queue_ data Structure is a colletion of objects which is optimized for adding new objects to the collections  and removing the oldest object to the collection. The first object that gets in is the first object that gets out(FIFO).

A grocery line serves as a simple real-world example of a queue: where the first person gets int the line is the first person to be entertained or serviced(and eventually leaves).

### Queue Abstract Data Type, has its own methods:
- #### Update Methods
  - _**enqueue(e)**_ - _Adds_ e to the end of the queue.
  - _**dequeue()**_ - _Removes_ and returns the element in the front of the queue, or _null_ if the queue is empty.
  
- #### Accessor Methods
  - _**size()**_ - _Returns_ the number of elements in the Queue.
  - _**isEmpty()**_ - _Returns_ true if there is no elements in the queue.
  - _**first()**_ - _Returns_ the element at the fromt of the queue(oldest one among all).
  
##### We can implement Queue in Different programming languages like:
- **Java** : There is no Queue class in Java. However, the `LinkedList` class methods allows us to use the list as a queue. 
- **JavaScript** : There is no special prototype in JavaScript. The Array prototype, however, sipports the `push` & `shift` methods that emulate the behaviour of queue.
- **Python** : You can instantiate queues using the queue module in `python3`, or the Queue module in `python2`. The insertion method is called `put`, while removal one is 'get'.
- **C++** : Queues in C++ are the part of the `std::queue` library. In this case, elements can be inserted by using `push` & removed by using `pop`.
