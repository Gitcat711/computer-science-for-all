## The Graph Data Structure.


### General Trivia
**Graph** are way of representing relationships between pairs of objects. They consist of objects(called **_nodes_** or **_vertices_**) and the pairwise connections between them (called **_edges_**)

 **1. Undirected ** - In Undirected graphs, the edges don't have a notion of direction.

 **2. Directed(digraph) graphs** - In Directed graphs the edges have direction, like one-way street. `e.g.` _LinkedLists_ are special kind of directed graphs.

 **3.** There can be more _directed_ edges with t

> Graphs can be used to represent friendships on social networks. Facebook, for instance, is organised as a __Undirected graph__(you appear of on each others _friend's list_), while Twitter, is organised as __directed graph__
(you can follow someone without them having to follow you back)
