### The Array Data Structure.

An *array* data structure is an organized collection of elements, for which *indexes* are used access its context. The same information may occur in an array more than once, but at different index locations. A picture that depicts it:

 We can differentiate between arrays based on whether their size is declared up-front(_static_) or able to change at a run-time(_dynamic_). A good example is of bookshelf. You start placing the first book in the left side of the shelf, following with each book to the right of the last one, until there is no more space.
 
 In this case, each book has its own allocated space and you can straight up see the _title_ and author on the side of the book. A _Dynamic_ bookshelf would resize itself as soon as there is no more room for the another book, while a _static_ one wouldn't. Some ways to declare array in commonly known programming languages:

 ```Java
 int[] playerArr = {23. 45, 67}; //Java
 ```
 ```c++
 int playerArr[] = {23, 45, 67}; //C++
 ```
 ```python 
 from array import array
 playerArr = array('i', [23, 67, 99]) #Python
 ```
 ```javascript
 var playerArr = [12, "Sergio", "sane"]; // JavaScript
```
The advantage of an array is that you have immediate access to its elements. All you have to do is specify the index of the element you are looking for:
```
elm = playerArr[0];
```
*Swap the order to assign a value to the index:*
```
playerArr[0] = elm;
```
