#### Assorted Study Notes.

1. **First Gist**
 1. When a matrix is squared, the _eigenvectors_ remains the same. Whereas, when the matrix is squared, the _eigenvalues_ are also squared.(Linear Algebra.)
 2. For given set of integer values median is that element which come  the middle of sorted sequence of integers. SO if we choose pivot as middle element then after partition algorithm the pivot go to the middle and complete array will be divided exactly into two halves. In such scenarios, Quick sort perform at it's best. Time Complexity - `O(nlogn)` (Algorithms)
 3. Worst case complexities of insertion and deletion of a key in a binary search tree. `O(n)` for both _insertion_ and deletion. When the binary search tree is skewed.
 4. The size of array is fixed. So we must know the upper limit of the no. of elements in advance.
 5. Also, generally the allocated memory is equal to the upper limit irrespective of the usage, and in practical usage the upper limit is rarely reached.
