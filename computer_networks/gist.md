- **Network Interface** - A network interface can refer to any kind of software interface to networking hardware. Fo instance, if you have two network cards in your computer, you can control and configure each network interface assoicated with them individually.
> A network interface may be associated with a physical device, or it may be a representation of a virtual interface. The "loopback" device, which is a virtual interface to the local machine, is example of this.
- **LAN**  - LAN stands for _Local Area Network_. It refers to a network that is not publicly accessible to the greater internet. A home or office plays a perfect example of what lan is.
