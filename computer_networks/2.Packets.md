## Packet

**Think of packets<sup>[1]</sup> as the simplest unit of communication in computer networks.** Whatever the nature of the communication over a computer network might be, data must be sent and received. 

_Data transmission_:- the action of sending data over a network works in the following way:

- original data is broken down in smaller structure of data- `packets`
- `packets` are transmitted followiingthe rules of the _protocol_ used.
- when `packets` reach their destination, they are _reassembled_ into the original data.

A packet is composed of **header** and a **payload**(the actual data sent). The content of the header depends on the protocol used for transmission. Over the internet, where _IP_(Internal Protocol) is the standard, packets **header** needs to have:

- source IP address
- destination IP address
- type of service(used for optimizations)
- flags
- other technical data

In the latter type of networks, packets are sent over the internet through _nodes_<sup>[2]</sup>(devices and routers) positioned between the _source_ and _destination_.

###### Footnotes.
1. **PACKETS**
	- other relavant terms for _packets_ are datagrams, segments, blocks, cells and even frames, depending on the protocol used for data transmission.
2. **HOW TO NODES WORK?**
	- Contrary to _traditional lines_ of communcation, such as telephone lines, where there must be a continuous physical link between the source and destination, modem networks work on a different concept. Packets are routed from _source_ to _destination_, going through **nodes**. At each node calculations are made deciding the most efficient route of reaching the destination.
